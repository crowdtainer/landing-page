## How it works?

We need to create a more efficient trade than what exists today. Cutting the middle men means selling directly to the coffee drinkers.

Shipping coffee overseas (in this first case, from Brazil to Europe), requires volume, therefore it only makes sense if we can sell it to enough people to fill up a container.

To do so, an Ethereum smartcontract (source code) drives a coffee crowdsale of the farms production.

If the funding goal **is not** reached, the money can be released from the smart contract back to the buyers.

If however, the funding goal **is** reached, the coffee is considered sold and production kicks in - that would make the it first significant coffee trade organized by code and people instead of huge corporations.


#### When you buy coffee *through a big retailer*, most of your money goes to monopolies and middle man. A tiny fraction goes to the farmers and the people that put the hard work to make it happen.

By purchasing coffee *through Crowdtainer instead, most of the money goes to **producing the coffee itself** (the farmers and the coffee processing units), and another part will help **fund development towards a more open and fair marketplace for coffee trade**:

* The farmers get **better prices** for the coffee they produce
* Consumers pay the similar or better prices compared to their local market
* Both parties benefit from a **closer relationship** and **sharing of values** (e.g. environmental responsibility, human care)

#### Think of it as an ICO, except instead of giving you '*tokens*', we ship *real coffee*.

### The *happy* path:

1. Choose the amount and roast level
2. Pay with DAI token 
3. The funding goal is reached ‚úÖ
4. Get the next harvest specialty coffee ‚òïÔ∏è delivered to your door üè†

### The *unhappy* path:

1. Choose the amount and roast level
2. Pay with DAI token
3. The funding goal is *not* reached ‚ùå
4. Clam your DAI tokens back in full.

### What you need to know:

* The product you get as a participant in the first Crowdtainer wave is **roasted coffee beans** in small packages of 500 grams or 1 Kilogram.
* The delivery address is **never** saved on the Blockchain or made public anyhow: we follow **GDPR** rules, and collect only the information needed for delivery purposes. Such information is sent off-chain in encrypted form to our centralised severs, and will be destroyed once the item is shipped. 
* For the first Crowdtainer, only **European Union** customers are eligible.
* 1 DAI approximates 1 US Dolar. We use **DAI** instead of **Ether** (or bitcoin for that matter) to avoid volatility. The *_DAI_* is a USD-pegged stablecoin token that exists on the Ethereum network, the same where crowdtainer is conducted.
* **IMPORTANT:** We assume that the smartcontracts will operate as intended per description above, where we will be responsible for delivering the coffee **if and only if** the funds are made available to us (that is, the payment reaches our wallet). Therefore, the buyer must be aware and willing to accept the risks involved with blockchain and smart contract security. We accept **help auditing the smartcontracts** or **donations** to the following address: **0xasldkfjasldkfjlkjskldf**
* A dashboard is provided to keep track of the funding status. Even it it fails, the information can still be queried through Ethereum blockchain.
