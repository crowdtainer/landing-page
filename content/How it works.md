#### The *happy* path:

1. Choose the amount and roast level
2. Pay with DAI token 
3. The funding goal is reached ‚úÖ
4. Get the next harvest specialty coffee ‚òïÔ∏è delivered to your door üè†

#### The *unhappy* path:

1. Choose the amount and roast level
2. Pay with DAI token
3. The funding goal is *not* reached ‚ùå
4. Claim your DAI tokens back.

When we buy coffee *through a retailer*, most of the money goes to monopolies and middlemen. A tiny fraction goes to the farmers and the people that put the hard work to make it happen:

<br />

The problem is further aggravated since the middlemen shown above are usually the same conglomerate, for a whole different set of farmers and consumers.

By purchasing coffee *through Crowdtainer instead*, since there is no middlemen (trade is organized by code), the money goes to **producing the coffee itself** (the farmers and the coffee processing units) and incentivising development towards a **more open and fair marketplace for coffee trade**:

<br />

* The farmers get **better prices** for the coffee they produce
* Consumers pay the similar or better prices compared to their local market
* Both parties benefit from a **closer relationship** and **sharing of values** (e.g. environmental responsibility, human care, transparency and traceability)


### What you need to know:

* For the first Crowdtainer, only **European Union** customers are eligible.

* The product you get as a participant in the first Crowdtainer wave is **roasted coffee beans** in small packages of 500 grams or 1 Kilogram.

* The delivery address is **never** saved on the Blockchain or made public anyhow: we follow **GDPR** rules, and collect only the information needed for delivery purposes. Such information is sent off-chain in encrypted form to our centralised severs, and will be destroyed once the item is shipped. 

* 1 DAI approximates 1 US Dolar. We use **DAI** instead of **Ether** (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) to avoid volatility. The *_DAI_* is a USD-pegged stablecoin token that exists on the Ethereum network.

* **IMPORTANT:** We assume that the smart contracts will operate as intended per description above, where we will be responsible for delivering the coffee **if and only if** the funds are made available to us (that is, the payment reaches our ethereum account). Therefore, the buyer must be aware and willing to accept the risks involved with blockchain, smart contract security, and any other unexpected risks of bootstrapping a new sale channel.

<!-- > ### The challange is to create a more efficient trade than what exists today. Cutting the middlemen means farmers selling directly to coffee drinkers or roasters. -->

<!-- Shipping coffee overseas (in this first case, from Brazil to Europe) requires volume: it only makes sense if we can sell it to enough people to fill up a container.

To do so, an Ethereum smartcontract (source code) drives a coffee crowdsale of the farms production.

If the funding goal **is not** reached, the money can be released from the smart contract back to the buyers.

If however, the funding goal **is** reached, the coffee is considered sold and production kicks in - that would make the it first significant coffee trade organized by code and people instead of huge corporations. -->
