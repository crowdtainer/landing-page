## TLDR:
#### The *happy* path:

1. Choose the amount and roast level
2. Pay with DAI token 
3. The funding goal is reached ‚úÖ
4. Get the next harvest specialty coffee ‚òïÔ∏è delivered to your door üè†

#### The *unhappy* path:

1. Choose the amount and roast level
2. Pay with DAI token
3. The funding goal is *not* reached ‚ùå
4. Claim your DAI tokens back.

### Things to note:

* For the first Crowdtainer, only **European Union** customers are eligible.

* The product you get as a participant in the first Crowdtainer wave is **roasted coffee beans** in small packages of 500 grams or 1 Kilogram.

* The delivery address is **never** saved on the Blockchain or made public anyhow: we follow **GDPR** rules, and collect only the information needed for delivery purposes. Such information is sent off-chain in encrypted form to our centralised severs, and will be destroyed once the item is shipped. 

* 1 DAI approximates 1 US Dolar. We use **DAI** instead of **Ether** (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) to avoid volatility. The *_DAI_* is a USD-pegged stablecoin token that exists on the Ethereum network.

* **IMPORTANT:** We assume that the smart contracts will operate as intended per description above, where we will be responsible for delivering the coffee **if and only if** the funds are made available to us (that is, the payment reaches our ethereum account). Therefore, the buyer must be aware and willing to accept the risks involved with blockchain, smart contract security, and any other unexpected risks of bootstrapping a new sale channel.


## Longer explanation:

When we buy coffee *through a retailer*, most of the money goes to monopolies and middlemen. A tiny fraction goes to the farmers and the people that put the hard work to make it happen:

<br />

<br />

The problem is further aggravated since the middlemen shown above are usually the same conglomerate, for a whole different set of farmers and consumers.

Even coffee cooperatives, for example in Brazil, based on our own experience, have dubious terms and pays questionable prices to local farmers.

If we can reduce the number of middle agents in the supply chain (who are simply trading between two sides of a network), then there is less space for monopolies to emerge and exploit their position. So instead of having a relatively **small, centralized hub and spoke network** with **big players**, we aim towards a **network with more nodes** composed of **smaller (but more numerous) players**, i.e., shifting from a centralized network towards the a more distributed one.

We might achieve this by decreasing information asymmetry between the parties involved, while carefully balancing incentives so that a trustworthy ecosystem can grow while the trust is slowly transfered away from central players and towards smaller producers.

By purchasing coffee *through Crowdtainer*, since there is way less middlemen involved (some of the trust assumptions are placed on the source code), the money can go more directly to **producing the coffee itself** (the farmers and the coffee processing units) and incentivising development towards a **more open and fair marketplace for coffee trade**:

<br />

<br />

* The farmers get **better prices** for the coffee they produce
* Consumers pay the similar or better prices compared to their local market, with more varieties to choose from.
* Both parties benefit from a **closer relationship** and **sharing of values** (e.g. environmental responsibility, human care, transparency and traceability, or other community values in other instances of crowdtainer)

## Long term vision

This trust transfer is the most difficult part of the project. Afterall, the basic role of the middlemen (and why it emerged) is for both sides of the network to be able to trust each other with little friction as possible. So, we need to take one step at a time, and attempt to make the system robust enough that it can grow overtime to include new players, but without being gamed or unfair.

While the status quo of this project still relies on you trusting *us* via traditional contractual agreement (backed by the traditional court system and legal laws - i.e., a normal purchase-sale agreement) , we see this is a stepping stone to develop systems where one needs to rely less on such trust assumptions, but instead build atop a carefully designed incentive system.

For now, we are keeping things simple, and the only incentives are: one, a buyer's wish for great coffee, and two, a referral system where a buyer whose promotion code is used in a subsequent purchase is rewared via smartcontract (i.e., a promotion code is redeemed). 

That said, we do have some really interesting ideas to share later on. This problem that is portrayed here as a coffee-specific supply chain issue is actually present in many other places and other small business, so although we are building this first in the spirit of "solving one's own problem", we think this can be generalised for many other projects (maybe yours too!).

For now, we count on you to support us on our first step :)

<!-- > ### The challange is to create a more efficient trade than what exists today. Cutting the middlemen means farmers selling directly to coffee drinkers or roasters. -->

<!-- Shipping coffee overseas (in this first case, from Brazil to Europe) requires volume: it only makes sense if we can sell it to enough people to fill up a container.

To do so, an Ethereum smartcontract (source code) drives a coffee crowdsale of the farms production.

If the funding goal **is not** reached, the money can be released from the smart contract back to the buyers.

If however, the funding goal **is** reached, the coffee is considered sold and production kicks in - that would make the it first significant coffee trade organized by code and people instead of huge corporations. -->
