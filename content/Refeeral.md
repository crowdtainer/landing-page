Since the first crowdtainer wave will rely on word-of-mouth only, we added a **referral program** to the smart contract:

- Upon a purchase, a coupon / referral code is generated
- Each subsequent purchase made using the referral code will provide a 10% discount for the buyer, and 10% of the purchase value goes to the referral code owner.

Of course, these are only effective and claimable if the minimum funding goal is reached successfully.
