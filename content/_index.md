## Enjoy a *different* coffee this year.

Most coffee sold are composed of a mix of several coffee types and sources, causing the root characteristics and unique flavours typical of a region to disappear.
**Discover the original flavours and the experiences a cup of coffee can bring**.

## Make a *positive* impact to the world.

The coffee chain is so full of middle-man, that the ones putting hard work to make it happen are the least rewarded. What if we can bring like-minded people together to revert the situation?

## We believe in a more *responsible* way to source coffee.

One thing is what someone tells us through a label or certificate, another is to be able to *know* the impact the choices we make as a consumer does. Each package bought through crowdtainer has a traceable history, made available through the internet.

## Enter Crowdtainer - Crowdfunding a container

It would be impossible to reach the goals above, and yet trade specialy coffee with small farmers because economies of scale is needed: sending anything less than one coffee container overseas is not economically sustainable.

With the help of programmable money and people like you, we can finally make it happen: if the funding goal **is not** reached, the money can be released from the smart contract back to the buyer.

If the funding goal **is** reached, the coffee is considered sold and production kicks in.
