### Specialty coffee is more than ever seen as a commodity, and consumers are happy to pay good money for a good cup of coffee. In the other end of the coffee chain, an increasing number of farmers are paid ever less for their product and many live in near poverty.

The difficulty of coordinating producers of raw materials with buyers of a finished products creates a demand and fertile ground for middleman that act basically as a coordinator. The problem is aggravated due to the profit advantages in keeping information of buyers, sellers and prices secret, which in turn makes the marketplace more like an illiquid series of gatekeepers instead of a bazaar full of competitors. 

### The establishment of monopolies and middle-man makes opportunity no longer equal for everyone and favours just a few established players.

What is the option left to small farmers (which collectively produce the majority of the traded coffee) ? You guessed: sell ultra cheap to local traders, which sells to bigger cooperatives, which sells to another trader in the importing country, which in turn sells to coffee shops and customers.

Some call this **the coffee paradox**: Small coffee producers aren’t able to get the best value for their product because there is no connection between the final customer and the farm.

Consumers on the other hand, generally don’t have as much variety of choices because their only available options are those provided by the existing coffee elite groups / traders.

Some well intentioned roasters, knowing about this problem, hand-pick farmers (while taking a lot of risk), to at least do some social good through a more **direct trade** approach. But unfortunately, that is mostly the exception than the rule, since the approach doesn't really scale.

In the end, farmers are poorly paid, and are not incentivized to produce great coffee (because it won't be well paid for anyways), and yet such coffee is sold at a premium price to you. So, out of the price you pay, almost nothing ends up returning to the people that actually does the hard work at the farms.

### A liquid market place where vital information (such as volume, reputation, and price) can flow freely, is needed.

This project is an attempt to redistribute power, by taking advantage of programmable money to establish such connections.

The picture below was taken on 23rd December 2018 from our family's farm:

If you **feel compelled enough as we do**, the next crop will be different from all the others: instead of being sold to local traders, the beans you see above will be sold through a community of people like you who cares about what they drink, and all the people involved in the process.
