<!-- ## Enjoy a *different* coffee this year.

Did you know that most coffee sold is composed of a mix of several coffee types and sources, causing root characteristics and unique flavours typical of a region to disappear?
**Discover the original flavours and the experiences a cup of coffee can bring**.

## Make a *positive* social impact.

No one has yet been able to find a solution for today's **unfair coffee chain**: the ones putting hard work to make it happen are still the least rewarded - **middle men captures almost all of its value**. What if we can bring like-minded people together to revert the situation?

## We believe a more *responsible* way to source coffee is possible.

Did you ever wonder what a certificate label really means, if anything? Instead of wondering, we should be able to **see** the impact the choices we make as consumers has. Each package bought through crowdtainer has history and a closer connection to its origin. -->

## Meet Crowdtainer - Crowdfunding containers

It would be impossible to reach such goals and yet buy specialy coffee from small farmers, because economies of scale is needed: sending anything less than one coffee container overseas is not economically sustainable.

Crowdtainer makes use of **Ethereum smart contracts** in an attempt to organize people's payment using programming money so that it flows directly to the coffee producers when it makes sense to.
