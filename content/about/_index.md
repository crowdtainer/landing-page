## Crowdtainer: Crowdfunding a Container

At its surface, Crowdtainer looks much like a standard crowdfunding platform, but if you look under the hood, you'll soon see quite a big difference: A protocol sits at its core, and not a company.

In this first instance, we have a single company that we use to "dog-food" the project in a raise for overseas specialty coffee. But long term, we hope you'll find here a supportive community that shares a set of **open source tools** to allow you and others to coordinate towards shared goals no matter one's background or jurisdiction.

We want to empower the many small entrepreneurs or communities that has been either marginalized by monopolies, or that had its idea blocked by frictions related to capital, to discover product-market fit at much lower costs.

Although a goal can be as simple as a **group buy / bulk order** for a certain neighbourhood, it can also serve very different purposes such as special aid missions.

*We'd like to see people building companies on their own using free, accessible tools, instead of us being a company that projects would be at the mercy of.*

We have all seen what happens when a corporation / organization becomes too big: they fail to properly capture the values and interest of their members or people they affect. It may well be more efficient to instead, have smaller (but more numerous) communities which in turn cooperate with each other, in whatever structure it makes sense: be it **DAOs, Cooperatives, Non-profit Foundations, or Companies**. We are merely an attempt of creating one such of community.

Our design goals:

- Build/inspire **numerous small communities** (instead of few, huge companies or organizations).
- Avoid intermediaries as much as possible, while still rewarding those that help coordinate and deliver.
- Focus on **clear, mission-oriented** projects with **well specified time and scope**.
- Build more transparency by connecting **producers closer to consumers**.
- Provide **equal opportunity** to people with limited market access or remote regions.

We attempt to bootstrap this ecosystem with our first project related to coffee, hoping this instance will succeed in funding, in order to become a proof of concept that inspires you and other communities to develop such idea and tools further:

The current smart contracts helps to form a 'bulk purchase', reducing costs for the whole group due improved logistics, enabling otherwise not viable projects.

Buyers then have more diversity of products and services to choose from, at a potentially lower cost. At the supply side, projects that were formerly impossible due low economies of scale or tragedy of common goods problems, may now become a possibility.

## Trust

This trust transfer is the most difficult part of this project. Afterall, the basic role of the middlemen (and why it emerged) is for both sides of the network to be able to trust each other with little friction as possible. So, we need to take one step at a time, and attempt to make the system robust enough that it can grow overtime to include new players, but without being gamed or unfair.

While the status quo of this project still relies on you trusting *us* via traditional contractual agreement to deliver on our promises of a coffee sale (backed by the traditional court system and legal laws - i.e., a normal purchase-sale agreement), we see this is a stepping stone to build initial trust.

For now, we are keeping things simple, and the only incentives are: one, a buyer's wish for great coffee, and two, a referral system where a buyer whose promotion code is used in a subsequent purchase is rewared via smart contract (i.e., a promotion code is redeemed). 

That said, we do have some really interesting ideas to share later on. This problem that is portrayed here as a coffee-specific supply chain issue is actually present in many other places and other small business, so although we are building this first in the spirit of "solving one's own problem", we think this can be generalised for many other projects (maybe yours too!).

For now, we count on you to support us on our first step :)
