Coffee is a major export commodity, being the top legal agricultural export for numerous countries such as Brazil - meaning, **it is an important source of income to hundreds of thousands of families for a living**. 

Total green coffee production is estimated at **9,7 million of tonnes (2018)** ([source](http://www.ico.org/documents/cy2018-19/cmr-1018-e.pdf)). For comparison purposes, soybean production is about **346,02 million of tonnes (2018)** ([source](https://www.soymeal.org/soy-meal-articles/world-soybean-production/)).

Easily automated crops such as soybean allows investors to have a stable return at scales already, which is important to help feed the global population (at the cost of environmental impact), **but it depends on proper taxing to redistribute income to its people**. Given the huge income inequality in developing nations, we can say that regulations **haven't done that much of a great job** with either collecting or making wise use of the collected tax.

Given regulations changes slowly (if for good), combined with the fact that soybeans are already at the hands of big investors, it is hard to imagine how technological improvements could have better positive social impact for a nation's population in such system - a farmer can't even compete price-wise with their automated competitors. Their option is to adapt to other types of work or starve.

What's interesting to note is that, **differently** from industries such as that of Soybeans, most of the coffee produced is cultivated by small farmers, **because it can't be easily automated with machinery** (automation costs in most cases are too high to be viable at the irregular terrain where specialty coffee can be cultivated) - yet, a few big players did manage to create a monopoly and take the bigger part of the pie by sitting right in the middle of the coffee trade.

Some well intentioned roasters **do the extra work** of trying to find reliable farms themselves, but the approach of each roaster doing this on their own is expensive and doesn't scale very well - therefore **only a few farms gets discovered** and are able to trade this way (known as (Direct Trade)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_trade]).

This seems like a fertile ground for experimenting with a real-life use case of technologies such as blockchain for social good - what is missing here is a reliable link between the small farmers and consumers. If this link can be established through a blockchain protocol, **it has to potential to impact, in short term, the lives of millions that makes their living out of coffee**, without depending on changes of regulation.

In our context, real value means **distributing work rewards more fairly**, and **real people** means those unserved the most within the global economy.

**A liquid market place where vital coffee market information (such as volume, reputation, and price) can flow freely, is needed.**

Crowdtainer is an attempt take advantage of programmable money to establish such connections at scale, to make it possible for small farmers in similar situation to that of our family, to be discoverable a able to trade in a more global context - a trade between producer directly the final coffee drinker (or roaster).

**The fundamental thought behind Crowdtainer is a trade solely between people adding value to the product.**

As such, in an attempt to empower the farmers and give more visibility to coffee drinkers, a core part of Crowdtainer is cut out the middlemen who does not add value to the product.

**However, the current middlemen does play a role today**: that of organizing the demand/supply for coffee trading and ensuring quality. Despite unfair to our eyes, the current system does manage **the reputation side of things**. The financial market where coffee is traded is important for a lot of reasons, but when the power of fictional numbers overtakes the economy in real life, it can have significant consequences for the people actually providing the product.

So the first step has to be that of you, the reader, to believe in this idea and giving us a chance to prove that trade can be done more directly, at larger scales than only a few well-intentioned roasters.

Now, for those unfamiliar, a coffee plantation produces coffee once per year, in a month range that varies with its latitude.

In Minas Gerais, where Crowdtainer's initial farms are located, harvest generally starts end of May, has its peak in July, and lasts until the end of September, when almost all coffee has been harvested. The reason harvest can take so long is also for the fact that most specialty coffee needs to be hand-picked due the irregular and steep terrain angles that machines can't reach.

The picture below was taken on 23rd December 2018 from our family's farm.

As you can see, the trees are already packed with green coffee fruits.

If you **feel compelled enough** (as we do), this next crop will be different from all the others: instead of being sold to local traders, the beans you see above will be sold through a community of people like you who cares about what they drink, and all the people involved in the process.

For that, we need to bootstrap this trust relationship. **Be part of this story, join Crowdtainer on our first attempt to create a more fair link between farmers, roasters, and coffee drinkers**.
