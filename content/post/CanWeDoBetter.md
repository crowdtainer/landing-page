> “If we want crypto to get more adoption, it has to be by providing real value to people” - Vitalik Buterin at ETHGlobal 2019

In our context, real value means distributing work rewards more fairly, and real people means those unserved the most.

**A liquid market place where vital coffee market information (such as volume, reputation, and price) can flow freely, is needed.**

Crowdtainer is an attempt take advantage of programmable money to establish connections that so far were not possible for small farmers like in our family - that of the coffee producer directly the final coffee drinker.

**The fundamental thought behind Crowdtainer is a trade solely between people adding value to the product.**

As such, in an attempt to empower the farmers and give more visibility to coffee drinkers, a core part of Crowdtainer is cut out the middlemen who does not add much value to the product.

However, the current middle men does play a role today: that of organizing the demand/supply for coffee trading and ensuring quality. Despite unfair to our eyes, the current system does manage the reputation side of things.

Now, for those unfamiliar, a coffee plantation produces coffee once per year, in a month range that varies with its latitude. 

In Minas Gerais, where Crowdtainer's initial farms are located, harvest generally starts on April, has its peak in July, and by the end of September there's not much left. The reason harvest can take so long is also for the fact that most specialty coffee needs to be hand-picked due the high altitude and steep terrain angles that machines can't reach.

The picture below was taken on 23rd December 2018 from our family's farm. As you can see, the trees are already packed with green coffee fruits:

If you **feel compelled enough (as we do)**, this next crop will be different from all the others: instead of being sold to local traders, the beans you see above will be sold through a community of people like you who cares about what they drink, and all the people involved in the process.

For that, we need to bootstrap this trust relationship.
