### Specialty coffee is more than ever seen as a commodity, and consumers are happy to pay good money for a good cup of coffee. In the other end of the coffee chain, farmers are paid ever less for their product and many live in poverty.

The difficulty of coordinating producers of raw materials with buyers of a finished product creates a demand and fertile ground for middleman that act basically as a coordinator. The problem is aggravated due to profit advantages in keeping information of buyers, sellers and prices secret, which in turn makes the marketplace more like an illiquid series of gatekeepers instead of a bazaar full of competitors. 

### With the establishment of monopolies and middle-man, opportunity is no longer equal for everyone and favours just a few established players - Because of such unequal market power relations, middle-man historically have been able to get a disproportionately high share of the pie.

What is the option left to small farmers - **which collectively produce the majority of the traded coffee** ? You guessed: sell ultra cheap to local traders, which sells to bigger cooperatives, which sells to another trader in the importing country, which in turn sells to coffee shops and customers.

Some scientists call this **the coffee paradox**: Small coffee producers aren’t able to get the best value for their product because there is no relationship connection between the final customer and the farm. Even for the few knowledgeable farmers that would attempt to sell at a trading house (e.g.: BOVESPA), the prices are extremely low.

[[TODO: insert prices from BOVESPA, CME Group ]]

The reality is that the concept of an "open-market" for coffee only exists for a few big corporations.

Consumers on the other hand, generally don’t have as much variety of choices because their only available options are those provided by the existing coffee elite groups / traders.

Some well intentioned roasters, knowing about this problem, hand-pick farmers (while taking a lot of risk), to at least do some social good through a more **direct trade** approach. But unfortunately, that is mostly the exception than the rule, since the approach doesn't really scale.

In the end, farmers are poorly paid, and are not incentivized to produce great coffee (because it won't be well paid for anyways), and yet such coffee is sold at a premium price to you. So, out of the price you pay, almost nothing ends up returning to the people that actually does the hard work at the farms.

## Can we do better?

**A liquid market place where vital information (such as volume, reputation, and price) can flow freely, is needed.**

Crowdtainer is an attempt to redistribute power, by taking advantage of programmable money to establish the connections that so far were not possible for small farmers like us.

**The fundamental thought behind Crowdtainer is a trade solely between people adding value to the product.**

As such, in an attempt to empower the farmers, a core part of Crowdtainer is cut out the middlemen who does not add value to the product, but do so in an economically sustainable way.

The picture below was taken on 23rd December 2018 from our family's farm:

If you **feel compelled enough as we do**, this next crop will be different from all the others: instead of being sold to local traders, the beans you see above will be sold through a community of people like you who cares about what they drink, and all the people involved in the process.
