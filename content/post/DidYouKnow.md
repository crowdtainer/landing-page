### Specialty coffee is more than ever seen as a commodity, and consumers are happy to pay good money for a good cup of coffee. In the other end of the coffee chain, farmers are paid ever less for their product and many live in poverty.

The difficulty of coordinating producers of raw materials with buyers of a finished product creates a demand and fertile ground for middleman that act basically as a coordinator. The problem is aggravated due to profit advantages in keeping information of buyers, sellers and prices secret, which in turn makes the marketplace more like an illiquid series of gatekeepers instead of a bazaar full of competitors. This is not exclusive to coffee industry, but more apparent for us due our experience.

### With the establishment of monopolies and middle-man, opportunity is no longer equal for everyone and favours just a few established players - Because of such unequal market power relations, middle-man historically have been able to get a disproportionately high share of the pie.

What is the option left to small farmers - **which collectively produce the majority of the traded coffee** ? You guessed: sell ultra cheap to local traders, which sells to bigger cooperatives, which sells to another trader in the importing country, which in turn sells to coffee shops and customers.

Some scientists call this **the coffee paradox**: Small coffee producers aren’t able to get the best value for their product because there is no relationship connection between the final customer and the farm. Even for the few knowledgeable farmers that would attempt to sell at a trading house (e.g.: BOVESPA), the prices are extremely low.

[[TODO: insert prices from BOVESPA, CME Group ]]

The reality is that the concept of an "open-market" for coffee only exists for a few big corporations.

Consumers on the other hand, generally don’t have as much variety of choices because their only available options are those provided by the existing coffee elite groups / traders.

Some well intentioned roasters, knowing about this problem, hand-pick farmers (while taking a lot of risk), to at least do some social good through a more **direct trade** approach. But unfortunately, that is mostly the exception than the rule, since the approach doesn't really scale.

**Besides price issues, there is an incentive misalignment: because farmers are poorly paid, they are not incentivized to produce the best coffee possible (because anything above the accepted standard won't be well paid for anyways by the traders in the middle).**

As a concrete example, the BOVESPA future contract instrument defines a certain type of quality that the coffee to be traded needs to meet. Although by rule a premium price *can* be paid for anything above the minimum standard, such definition is subjective and at the hands of the trader analyzing it.

In the end, a big amount of coffee loses its origin's unique flavours, in exchange for a more tradeable homogenous coffee market.

A solution the industry created to deal with coffee lots is to mix and match beans until a certain desired quality is reached (meaning add as much of higher quality beans to the lower quality ones, until the desired taste is reached).

Although having consistent quality across a large volume is important, doing so at a large scale might not be that great of an idea. We from Crowdtainer believe its possible to do much better if instead, the farmers and coffee processors are better incentivised, and the customer has more variety of options in the first place.
