A referral program is included in the Crowdtainer smart contract:

* Upon a coffee purchase, a coupon / referral code is generated.
* Each purchase made using the referral code will provide:
  *  **10% discount for the new purchase**
  *  **10% of the purchase value goes to the referral code owner.**

*Note: The discounts and rewards are only effective if the minimum funding goal is reached.*
