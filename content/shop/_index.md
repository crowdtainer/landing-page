### Things to note:

* For the first Crowdtainer, only **European Union** customers are eligible.

* The product you get as a participant in the first Crowdtainer wave is **roasted coffee beans** in small packages of 500 grams or 1 Kilogram.

* The delivery address is **never** saved on the Blockchain or made public anyhow: we follow **GDPR** rules, and collect only the information needed for delivery purposes. Such information is sent off-chain(and only given a crowdfunding succeeds) in encrypted form to our centralised servers, and will be destroyed once the item is shipped as soon as it is legally possible.

* 1 DAI approximates 1 US Dolar. We use **DAI** instead of **Ether** (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) to avoid volatility. The *_DAI_* is a USD-pegged stablecoin token that exists on the Ethereum network.

* **IMPORTANT:** We assume that the smart contracts will operate as intended per description above, where we will be responsible for delivering the coffee **if and only if** the funds are made available to us (that is, the payment reaches our ethereum account). Therefore, the buyer must be aware and willing to accept the risks involved with blockchain, smart contract security, and any other unexpected risks of bootstrapping a new sale channel.
